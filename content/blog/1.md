When I was writing this website/blog, I was looking for my old blog pages.
They were hosted on [aotsuae.com](https://aotsuae.com) a domain my dad owned for some reason.

Unfortunately, the source files got deleted from my code directory.
The `lf` file manager (very much similar to ranger) has the `Shift + D` key mapped to the `rm` (delete) command.
I accidently triggered it and lost all the files.

Most of the files were just temporary expriements. However, the source code to the first site was in that directory.
I have no back ups, so it is lost to time.

Moral of the story: Use [trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli) or alternatives.
