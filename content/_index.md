# Welcome to MuWare
Welcome to my website , I'm Aditeya. Here you'll find my blog where I ramble on about:
- computers
- software
- hardware
- games
- other things...

## Why MuWare?
Its a portmanteau of\
**Mu:** From [Arabian Mau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Mau), my favourite breed of cat,
but with the 'a' dropped so its the Greek letter Âµ or Mu (pronounced myew)\
and\
**Ware:** From Hardware or Software.
